# Thresholding => popular segmentation technic use for
# separating object from background
# (in this case use for grayscale picture 8 bit)

# the process divide all pixel input image into 2 group
# 1) pixel have intensity value lower than threshold
# 2) pixel have intensity value greater than threshold
